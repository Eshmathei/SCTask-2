# SkillCraft Internship – Task 2: Number Guessing Game (C++)

This is my submission for Task 2 of the SkillCraft Technology Software Development Internship.  
It is a simple number guessing game written in C++ where the computer picks a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it.

## How to Run

1. Open terminal in the project folder
2. Compile the program:
   
   g++ x.cpp -o guess
   
3. Run the program:
   
   .\guess.exe   (on Windows)
   

## Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Tells if the guess is too high or too low
- Tracks number of attempts
- Loop until the correct guess
- Clean and simple user interface

## Sample Output


Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I have selected a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 75
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 63
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
